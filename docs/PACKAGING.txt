HOW TO PACKAGE TAX HELPER FOR JEMMA'S LAPTOP
==============================================

Follow these steps to prepare the Tax Helper application for installation on Jemma's laptop:

STEP 1: PREPARE THE FILES
--------------------------
Copy the entire "Tax Helper" folder to a USB drive or cloud storage.

Essential files to include:
✓ app.py
✓ models.py
✓ requirements.txt
✓ INSTALL.bat (for Windows)
✓ INSTALL.sh (for Mac/Linux)
✓ RUN.bat (for Windows)
✓ RUN.sh (for Mac/Linux)
✓ README.md
✓ UK_TAX_COMPLIANCE.md
✓ UK_TAX_COMPLIANCE_SUMMARY.md
✓ FEATURES_IMPLEMENTED.md

Files to EXCLUDE (if present):
✗ tax_helper.db (this is your personal data - Jemma needs a fresh start)
✗ tax_helper.db-* (database backups)
✗ .DS_Store (Mac system files)
✗ __pycache__ (Python cache folders)
✗ .streamlit/secrets.toml (if you have any secrets)

STEP 2: CREATE A ZIP FILE (RECOMMENDED)
----------------------------------------
1. Select the "Tax Helper" folder
2. Right-click and choose "Compress" (Mac) or "Send to > Compressed folder" (Windows)
3. This creates "Tax Helper.zip"
4. Transfer this ZIP file via:
   - USB drive
   - Email (if under 25MB)
   - Cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud)
   - AirDrop (Mac to Mac)

STEP 3: INSTALLATION ON JEMMA'S LAPTOP
---------------------------------------
1. Transfer the ZIP file to Jemma's laptop
2. Extract/unzip the folder to a convenient location (e.g., Documents folder)
3. Have Jemma follow the instructions in README.md:

   For Windows:
   - Double-click INSTALL.bat
   - After installation completes, double-click RUN.bat

   For Mac:
   - Open Terminal, navigate to the folder
   - Run: chmod +x INSTALL.sh RUN.sh
   - Run: ./INSTALL.sh
   - Then: ./RUN.sh

STEP 4: VERIFY INSTALLATION
----------------------------
1. The browser should open automatically to http://localhost:8501
2. You should see the Tax Helper Dashboard
3. Try importing a test CSV file to verify everything works
4. Check that the app creates a fresh tax_helper.db file

TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS FOR JEMMA
-------------------------------
If Python is not installed:
- Download from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- IMPORTANT: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation on Windows

If installation fails:
- Try running INSTALL.bat/INSTALL.sh again
- Check internet connection (needed to download dependencies)

If app won't start:
- Check that port 8501 is not already in use
- Try restarting the computer

QUICK COMMAND REFERENCE
------------------------
Windows:
  Install: Double-click INSTALL.bat
  Run: Double-click RUN.bat

Mac/Linux:
  Install: ./INSTALL.sh
  Run: ./RUN.sh

NOTES
-----
- The database (tax_helper.db) will be created automatically when Jemma first runs the app
- Each person should have their own separate Tax Helper folder with their own database
- The app runs completely offline after installation (except when installing dependencies)
- All data is stored locally on the computer
